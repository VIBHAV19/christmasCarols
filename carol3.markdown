# Joy To The World

## LYRICS

># Joy to the world, the Lord is come
# Let earth receive her King
# Let every heart prepare Him room
# And heaven and nature sing
# And heaven and nature sing
# And heaven, and heaven and nature sing

># Joy to the world, the Savior reigns
# Let all their songs employ
# While fields and floods
# Rocks, hills and plains
# Repeat the sounding joy
# Repeat the sounding joy
# Repeat, repeat the sounding joy
# Here we go

># Joy, unspeakable joy
# An overflowing well
# No tongue can tell
# Joy, unspeakable joy
# It rises in my soul
# Never lets me go

># He rules the world, with truth and grace
# And makes the nations prove
# The glories of His righteousness
# And wonders of His love
# And wonders of His love
# And wonders, wonders of His love
# Joy!

># Joy, unspeakable joy
# An overflowing well
# No tongue can tell
# Joy, unspeakable joy
# It rises in my soul
# Never lets me go
