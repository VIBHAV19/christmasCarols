# O Christmas Tree

## LYRICS

># O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree
# How lovely are thy branches
# O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree
# How lovely are thy branches

># Your boughs so green in summertime
# Stay bravely green in wintertime
# O tannenbaum, o Christmas tree
# How lovely are thy branches

># Let us all remember
# In our gift giving and our merriment
# With our family and friends and loved ones
# The real and true meaning of Christmas
# The birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ

># O tannenbaum, o tannenbaum
# How lovely are, are thy branches
# O tannenbaum, o tannenbaum
# How lovely are, how lovely are thy branches

># The pillars all please faithfully
# Our trust in God unchangedly
# O tannenbaum, o tannenbaum
# How love, lovely are thy branches

># On Comet, on Cupid, on Donder and Blitzen
# Ha ha ha ha
